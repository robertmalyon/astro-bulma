# Astro template for working with Bulma

## Purpose of the project

I've set out to create a starter template for a web development projects using the Astro JS web framework and Bulma CSS framework installed and ready to use.

## Interesting features

- I've created a Bulma Nav but incorporated a nice fade-in easing transition for the menu that appears when the hamburger icon is pressed on smaller screens.
- I've created a NavStructure.JS file containing an array of objects, title:href
