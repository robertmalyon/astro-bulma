# Astro template for working with Bulma

I've created a basic template which has Bulma installed and working. I've added an overall scss stylesheet to modify Bulma's variables. I've also created a navbar component which incorporates some additional functionalities including:

- Transparent background which becomes opaque on scroll
- Easing transition on open mobile menu achieved with JS
